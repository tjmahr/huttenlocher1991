# huttenlocher1991

This package provides the vocabulary growth data from the following article:

> Huttenlocher, J., Haight, W., Bryk, A., Seltzer, M., & Lyons, T. (1991). Early
> vocabulary growth: Relation to language input and gender. *Developmental
> Psychology*, *27*(2), 236–248. <https://doi.org/10.1037/0012-1649.27.2.236>


This dataset is useful educationally because it features longitudinal/repeated
measures growth data. It is also unusual because in the associated article, the
only fixed effect predictor for growth is quadratic time--that is, there are
no intercept or linear time terms.

I retrieved this data from the [HLM software's examples
page](https://ssicentral.com/index.php/products/hlm-general/hlm-examples/) and
created a .csv-file out of it.


## Installation

You can install the development version of huttenlocher1991 like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("tjmahr/huttenlocher1991")
```

## Example

Here are the data all plotted.

```{r}
#| spag-1, fig.width = 3, fig.height = 2.5, dpi = 300, out.width = "50%"
library(huttenlocher1991)
library(tidyverse)

vocab_growth

ggplot(vocab_growth) + 
  aes(x = age, y = vocab) + 
  geom_line(aes(group = id))
```

Here is the "obvious" fully specified growth model.

```{r}
library(lme4)

m <- lmer(
  vocab ~ age_12 + age_12_sq + (age_12 + age_12_sq | id),
  vocab_growth
)
summary(m)
```

They note in footnote 2 that there was high collinearity between
π<sub>1*i*</sub> and π<sub>2*i*</sub> (the two random slopes) which we see
above.

They use a reduced quadratic model, which I think was basically:

```{r}
mr <- lmer(
  vocab ~  0 + age_12_sq + (0 + age_12_sq | id),
  vocab_growth
)
summary(mr)
```

There is no intercept because at x = 0 (age = 12 months), vocabulary should be 0 (?).

If I include `group`, I can reproduce the coefficients from Table 1, which makes
me think I am on the right track.

```{r}
mr_group <- lmer(
  vocab ~  0 + age_12_sq + age_12_sq:group + (0 + age_12_sq | id),
  vocab_growth
)
summary(mr_group)
```

Finally, we can recreate the figures:

```{r}
#| spag-2, fig.width = 3, fig.height = 2.5, dpi = 300, out.width = "50%"
library(broom.mixed)
data <- mr %>% 
  augment(newdata = vocab_growth)

ggplot(data %>% filter(id %in% c(11, 5, 7))) +
  aes(x = age, y = vocab, shape = factor(id)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(y = .fitted, linetype = factor(id))) + 
  guides(shape = "none", linetype = "none") + 
  labs(x = "age [months]", y = "vocabulary")

knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/f1.png")
```

Excluding the intercept entirely reminded me of nonlinear models, so can we just
one of those?

```{r}
nform <- ~ beta * input ^ 2
nfun <- deriv(
  nform, 
  namevec = "beta", 
  function.arg = c("input", "beta")
)

mr_nl <- nlmer(
  vocab ~ nfun(age_12, beta) ~ beta | id, 
  data = vocab_growth, 
  start = c(beta = 0)
)

summary(mr_nl)

fixef(mr_nl)
fixef(mr)

VarCorr(mr_nl)
VarCorr(mr)
```
